libraries used in this project:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- json (installed with python by default)
- tensorflow
- math (installed with python by default)


to run: 

[1] generating positions.json
(a positions.json should already be included in the file
but you can re-generate it)
-> run imp_pos_to_json.py

helper files:
1). find_consurf_intervals.py
-> has function find_intervals, takes in a consurf_scores.txt file
and outputs a list of intervals in format
[(start_pos, length of interval), (start_pos2, length2), ...]
2). reg_2.py
-> contains run_regression which runs the logistic regressor 
-> will return the mutual information score for a given interval
3). binary_vectors.py
-> construct_x gives the binary beatures by calling compare_string
(also inside binary_vectors.py)
-> construct_y gives the respective y-values

non-python files you need to make sure you have:
1). consurf_scores.txt (outputted by the consurf database when you input an alignment file)
2). distances.csv (contains 2D array of distances between each antigen and serum - produced 
by the cartography)
3). alignment.fa (outputted by jalview when you perform a muscle alignment or can be 
acquired online -- contains all sequence data (amino acid sequences for the HA protein))

[2] CNN
to run: 
-> run cnn.py
helper files:
1). aaindex_vectors.py are called by cnn.py for feature construction
2). get_metrics.py are called by cnn.py at the end of the run 
to get specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy

non-python files to make sure you have: 
(in addition to distances.csv and alignment.fa)
1-10). 10 .xlsx files containing aaindex information
(must be in same directory) 
-> names of these 10 aaindex files are stored as a list in aaindex_vectors.py
